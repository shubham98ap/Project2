                    <p> The notion of global fashion industry is a product of the modern age.Actually this industry is globalised before the age of silk route between India and China [24] Prior to the mid-19th century, most clothing was custom-made. It was handmade for individuals, either as home production or on order from dressmakers and tailors.
